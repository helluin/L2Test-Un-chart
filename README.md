# L2Test-Un-chart

I've always thought some visualizations are able to be revealing even without and actually better without axis and too much labeling. So, in this example, I took away both axises as an experiment. 

Tech-wise, I demonstrated how to use <em>class</em> in ES6 and how to modulize code for scaling and how to preserve "this" value using "bind()". The idea of writing this version of code only occurred to me the night before submitting this test. The use of "this" and "that" could have been better written.
