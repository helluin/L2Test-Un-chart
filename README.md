# L2Test-Un-chart

I've always thought some visualizations are able to be revealing even without and actually better without axis and too much labeling. So, in this example, I experimented on taking away both axises as well as blowing the visual to full-screen. 

Tech-wise, I demonstrated how to use <em>class</em> in ES6, how to modulize code for scaling and how to preserve "this" value using "bind()". The idea of writing this version of code only occurred to me the night before submitting this test. The use of "this" and "that" could have been better written.
